# Image_Classification_CIFAR10

Loading Libraries and Dataset:

Begin by installing essential packages and importing libraries, including TensorFlow for constructing and training neural networks. The CIFAR-10 dataset is loaded, containing 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 different classes.

Exploring Dataset:

Print the label of the second training sample and visualize its image using Matplotlib. This quick exploration provides insight into the dataset.

Preprocessing Data:

Normalize the pixel values of the images to the range [0, 1]. Reshape the images to have three channels, adapting to the color format. This preprocessing step is essential for model training.

Defining Model and Data Augmentation:

Define the architecture of the baseline Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using the baseline_model_creation function. The model includes convolutional layers, max-pooling, dropout for regularization, and dense layers for classification. An ImageDataGenerator is set up for data augmentation, enhancing the model's robustness.

Hyperparameter Tuning:

Define a search space for hyperparameters, including layer sizes, dropout rates, epochs, and batch sizes. Utilize RandomizedSearchCV to search for the best hyperparameters within the defined space. Evaluate the model's performance using cross-validation.

Training Model with Best Hyperparameters:

Create a new instance of the baseline model using the best hyperparameters obtained from the random search. Train the model using the augmented data generated by the ImageDataGenerator. Save the best-trained model to a file for future use.

Evaluating Model on Test Data:

Evaluate the model's performance on the test dataset to assess its generalization to unseen data. Calculate test accuracy to gauge the model's effectiveness.

Loading and Using the Model for Prediction:

Load the saved model, and define a predict function to make predictions on new images. Choose a test image from the CIFAR-10 dataset, and use the predict function to display the image and the model's predicted label.
